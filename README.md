# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

### json-server

json-server --watch ./src/db/data.json --port 3001

### git json-server

#

1. 활용할 db.json을 작성한다.
2. 작성환 db.json을 사용하기 위해 업로드할 github에 레지포트리를 만든다.
3. gihub에 레지포트리에 업로드한다.
4. https://my-json-server.typicode.com/github아이디/db가 있는 레지포트리

5. json-server 설정이 완료되었다면

6. 서버의 주소를 이용한다

### git에서 Repositories의 이름 설정

# Repositories를 본의의 id.githup.io로 정하는 경우

package.json에 "homepage": "https://본인의 아이디.github.io"를 추가한다.

# git에 여러 Repositories를 만들어 사용할 때

package.json에 "homepage": "https://본인의 아이디.github.io/압로드 할 Repositories이름"

### <BrowserRouter basename="/Repositories이름">

BrowserRouter요소에 basename="/Repositories이름"으로 작성한다.
